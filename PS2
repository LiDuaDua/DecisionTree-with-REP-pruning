2. Yes. Added a field called the "modeClass" to store the mode class passint the node in the training process
3. Split the unknown attributes into different values base on the ratio of the known values.
4. post order DFS + Reduce Error Pruning
    Traverse the tree from buttom up. 
    if the node is leaf, return 
    if the node is non-leaf and all its children are leaf, then replace the node by a leaf node which represents the modeCLass of the original node. If the accuracy does not reduce, then keep the pruning. Else cancel the pruning.

   We take this strategy because of its simplicity and high speed. This stategy only traverses the tree one time and achieve a O(n) time complexity.
